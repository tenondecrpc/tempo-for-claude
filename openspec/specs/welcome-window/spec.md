## Requirements

### Requirement: Welcome window opens from menu bar Sign In
A separate macOS window (SwiftUI `Window` scene, id "welcome") SHALL open when the user clicks "Sign In" in the menu bar popover. Clicking Sign In SHALL also close the menu bar popover synchronously before opening the window. The window SHALL be centered on screen, approximately 600×500pt, with a dark background.

#### Scenario: Window opens on Sign In click
- **WHEN** the user clicks "Sign In" in the not-signed-in popover
- **THEN** the popover closes and a centered "Welcome to Usage for Claude" window appears

#### Scenario: Window is a separate scene from MenuBarExtra
- **WHEN** the Welcome window is open
- **THEN** it exists as an independent window that can be focused and closed independently of the menu bar popover

### Requirement: Welcome window shows onboarding content
The window SHALL display:
1. Large bold title: "Welcome to Usage for Claude"
2. Subtitle: "Track your Claude Usage for Claude right from your menu bar or widget."
3. A preview/mockup area showing the authenticated menu bar state
4. Two action buttons at the bottom, side by side

#### Scenario: Onboarding content visible
- **WHEN** the Welcome window is displayed
- **THEN** the title, subtitle, preview area, and sign-in buttons are all visible

### Requirement: Sign in with Claude Code checks existing credentials first
The "Sign in with Claude Code" button SHALL first attempt to restore a session from stored credentials (including token refresh). Only if no valid credentials exist SHALL it initiate the OAuth PKCE browser flow. While checking, the button SHALL show a spinner for a minimum of 2 seconds before proceeding.

#### Scenario: Valid credentials restore session without browser
- **WHEN** the user clicks "Sign in with Claude Code" and valid credentials exist on disk
- **THEN** a spinner is shown for at least 2 seconds, then the session is restored and the window closes

#### Scenario: No credentials triggers OAuth flow
- **WHEN** the user clicks "Sign in with Claude Code" and no valid credentials exist
- **THEN** after the spinner, the OAuth PKCE authorization URL is opened in the default browser

### Requirement: Sign in with Email button is a disabled placeholder
The "Sign in with Email" button SHALL have a dark/gray background with white text and an envelope icon. It SHALL be visually distinct as non-functional (reduced opacity or "Coming Soon" label).

#### Scenario: Email button is not interactive
- **WHEN** the user clicks "Sign in with Email"
- **THEN** nothing happens (button is disabled or shows a "Coming Soon" message)

### Requirement: Welcome window auto-closes on authentication
The Welcome window SHALL close automatically when the user completes authentication (authState transitions to authenticated), but only after the minimum spinner duration has elapsed.

#### Scenario: Window closes after successful sign-in
- **WHEN** the OAuth flow completes and the user becomes authenticated
- **THEN** the Welcome window dismisses automatically

#### Scenario: Spinner does not block close on OAuth path
- **WHEN** the user completes OAuth in the browser (isAwaitingCode path)
- **THEN** the window closes immediately on authentication without waiting for a spinner

### Requirement: Welcome window uses dark theme
The window SHALL use `.preferredColorScheme(.dark)` and ClaudeTheme colors consistent with the menu bar popover.

#### Scenario: Dark appearance regardless of system setting
- **WHEN** the Welcome window opens on a system set to light mode
- **THEN** the window renders with dark background and light text
