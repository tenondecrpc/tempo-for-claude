## Purpose

Define how the macOS app polls usage and publishes durable usage snapshots for iCloud consumers and desktop widgets.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Usage polled every 15 minutes on macOS
The macOS app SHALL poll `GET https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage` at a **15-minute** interval after a successful poll while the user is authenticated. The request SHALL include `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` and `anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20` headers. A poll SHALL fire immediately on successful authentication.

The poller SHALL expose the latest `UsageState` as an observable property (`latestUsage: UsageState?`) so that SwiftUI views can reactively display current usage data without additional iCloud reads.

#### Scenario: Poll fires on schedule
- **WHEN** 15 minutes elapse since the last successful poll
- **THEN** the app issues a new `GET /api/oauth/usage` request

#### Scenario: Poll fires immediately after sign-in
- **WHEN** OAuth authentication succeeds
- **THEN** a poll is issued immediately without waiting for the 30-minute interval

#### Scenario: Latest usage state is observable by views
- **WHEN** a poll returns HTTP 200 with valid usage data
- **THEN** the `latestUsage: UsageState?` property is updated and any observing SwiftUI views re-render

### Requirement: Usage response mapped to UsageState and written to iCloud
The poller SHALL map the API response to `UsageState` (same mapping as `usage-polling` spec: divide utilization by 100, parse ISO 8601 dates). The resulting `UsageState` SHALL be encoded as JSON and written to `~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Tempo/usage.json`.

#### Scenario: UsageState written to iCloud
- **WHEN** a poll returns HTTP 200 with valid usage data
- **THEN** the mapped `UsageState` is encoded as JSON and written to `Tempo/usage.json` in iCloud Drive

#### Scenario: iCloud directory created if missing
- **WHEN** the `Tempo/` directory does not exist in iCloud Drive
- **THEN** the directory is created before writing `usage.json`

#### Scenario: Utilization normalized
- **WHEN** API returns `"five_hour": { "utilization": 79.0 }`
- **THEN** `UsageState.utilization5h` is `0.79` in the written JSON

### Requirement: Reset timestamp reconciliation preserves last known value
If the API response omits `resets_at` (null or missing), the poller SHALL retain the previously known reset timestamp in the written `UsageState`. A reset is detected when utilization drops after having been above 0 - in that case the old timestamp is discarded.

#### Scenario: Null resets_at preserves prior value
- **WHEN** the API returns `"resets_at": null` and a previous `resetAt5h` exists
- **THEN** the written `UsageState.resetAt5h` retains the previous value

### Requirement: Exponential backoff on 429
On HTTP 429, the poller SHALL back off exponentially. If a `Retry-After` header is present, that value (seconds) is used as the delay, bounded to at least 60 seconds. If no `Retry-After` header is present, the delay doubles from the current interval. The delay SHALL be capped at 3600 seconds. Normal 15-minute polling resumes after one successful response.

#### Scenario: 429 with Retry-After header
- **WHEN** the API returns 429 with `Retry-After: 120`
- **THEN** the next poll is delayed at least 120 seconds

#### Scenario: Recovery after 429
- **WHEN** a poll after backoff returns 200
- **THEN** the polling interval resets to 15 minutes

### Requirement: Tempo OAuth credentials updated after token refresh
When the poller triggers a Tempo OAuth token refresh due to a 401 or expiry, the new Tempo OAuth credentials SHALL be written back to the macOS Keychain before retrying the API call. Claude Code CLI credentials SHALL NOT be refreshed or written by Tempo.

#### Scenario: Keychain credentials updated after Tempo OAuth refresh
- **WHEN** a token refresh succeeds during polling
- **THEN** the Tempo OAuth Keychain item is updated with the new `access_token` and `expiresAt`

#### Scenario: CLI credentials are not refreshed
- **WHEN** a request using Claude Code CLI credentials returns 401
- **THEN** Tempo does not use Claude Code's refresh token and does not write to the Claude Code Keychain item

### Requirement: macOS writes widget snapshot after successful usage polls
After a successful macOS usage poll, the app SHALL derive a widget snapshot from the latest `UsageState` and write it to shared App Group storage for the macOS widget extension.

#### Scenario: Widget snapshot written after poll success
- **WHEN** the macOS poller receives a valid usage response and updates `latestUsage`
- **THEN** the app writes a corresponding widget snapshot to the macOS widget App Group storage

#### Scenario: Snapshot timestamp matches successful poll
- **WHEN** the app writes a widget snapshot after a successful poll
- **THEN** the snapshot records the successful poll time as its freshness timestamp

### Requirement: macOS reloads widget timelines only after valid snapshot writes
The macOS app SHALL request widget timeline reloads only after it has successfully written a valid widget snapshot. Failed polls SHALL NOT clear the previous valid widget snapshot.

#### Scenario: Widget timelines reloaded after valid write
- **WHEN** the app successfully writes a new widget snapshot
- **THEN** it calls WidgetKit reload APIs for Tempo's macOS widget kinds

#### Scenario: Failed poll preserves last valid widget content
- **WHEN** a macOS usage poll fails because of auth, rate limit, or network error
- **THEN** the previous valid widget snapshot remains in shared storage and is not deleted or overwritten
